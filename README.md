===========

This is to learn how GitHub works! I'm really glad a human is actually reading this. Now that you're here, I'll tell you a little bit about me:

I've been developing for more than 2 years now. I've developed web and mobile apps, worked as a freelance developer and done competitive programming. Android dev, machine learning, algorithms and frontend dev are my specialities right now. I'm actually a business student, but have taken some comp sci classes at college and have learned some stuff by my side.
